**Project Overview**

This project analyzes the results of a survey shared on LinkedIn targeting professionals working in data-related fields, including Data Scientists, Data Analysts, Data Engineers,  and Data Architects.
The goal was to collect insights about salaries, job satisfaction, work-life balance, programming languages, and demographic information (location, experience, etc.).

The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes the key findings obtained after data cleaning, wrangling, and exploratory analysis.

**Objectives**

-Understand the profile and work conditions of professionals in the data industry

-Analyze salary distribution across roles, regions, and experience levels

-Explore satisfaction regarding salary and work-life balance

-Identify the most commonly used programming languages

-Build a clean, interactive dashboard for decision-making and insight communication

**Data Cleaning & Preparation**
-The survey responses required several preprocessing steps:

-Handling missing or inconsistent entries

-Normalizing job titles and standardizing categories

-Cleaning salary values and converting them into a usable format

-Fixing formatting errors (strings, numerical values, categorical fields)

**Dashboard**

-The Power BI report includes:

-Salary overview page

-Job satisfaction & work-life balance page

-Programming languages analysis

The dashboard provides a clear, dynamic view of insights and allows users to explore the data according to their needs.

**Tools & Technologies**

The dataset was fully preprocessed and cleaned before being analyzed and visualized in Power BI.
